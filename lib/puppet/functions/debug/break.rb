# @summary Injects a puppet debugger session where the break point was placed.
#
# This function allows you to set a breakpoint and break into the puppet compiler
# allowing you to interact with the puppet manifest.  Think of this like a 
# interactive manifest where the scope, facts and code is setup for you to play
# with in real time. This function is similar to binding.pry for ruby but instead
# is use solely  with the puppet debugger which is just for puppet code only.
